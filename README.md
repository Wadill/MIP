# MIP: Miners' Incentive Platform

![MIP Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Replace with actual logo URL if hosted -->
*Empowering Bitcoin miners with hedging, pooling, and badges.*

Welcome to **MIP**, a decentralized platform built for the Citrea WaveHack to revolutionize Bitcoin mining incentives. Harnessing Citrea’s zkEVM technology, MIP offers miners tools to hedge rewards, pool resources, and earn social badges—all with a sleek, responsive frontend powered by React and Tailwind CSS. Launched on Citrea Testnet, this project blends DeFi innovation with Bitcoin’s ecosystem, proving the power of zero-knowledge rollups.

## 🚀 What It Does

MIP transforms the mining game by:

- **Hedging Tools**: Secure your rewards with futures and options contracts against Bitcoin’s wild price swings.
- **Resource Pooling**: Join forces with other miners to share computational power and boost collective earnings.
- **Social Rewards**: Earn shiny badges for heroic contributions like consistent mining or high uptime.

This platform, built on Citrea’s zkEVM, delivers fast, cost-efficient transactions, aligning with the WaveHack’s vision of scaling Bitcoin’s potential.

## ❗ The Problem It Solves

Bitcoin miners face relentless challenges:  
Price volatility threatens profits, solo mining can be isolating, and their hard work often goes unrecognized.

MIP steps in with:
- Financial stability through hedging
- Community strength via pooling
- Recognition and gamification with badges

It turns mining into a rewarding adventure rather than a risky gamble.

## 🧩 Challenges I Ran Into

- Deploying zk-rollups on Citrea Testnet—especially challenging at 08:39 AM WAT!
- MetaMask connection hiccups that tested patience.
- EVM opcode mismatches requiring a switch to the Shanghai version of the EVM.

---

## 🛠 Technologies I Used

- **React** – For building a dynamic frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** – For clean, modern, and responsive UI
- **ethers.js** – To interface with smart contracts
- **Hardhat & Remix** – For contract development and deployment
- **Citrea zkEVM** – The zk-rollup layer for scalability and low gas fees

---

## 🏗 How We Built It

Fueled by coffee and determination at **04:15 PM WAT, June 29, 2025**, MIP was solo-built from scratch:

1. Wireframes crafted at dawn
2. Frontend developed with React + Tailwind
3. Smart contract written and deployed via Hardhat
4. Seamless integration with Citrea Testnet

The result? A sleek, decentralized platform that’s as functional as it is beautiful.

## 📚 What We Learned

- The power of zk-rollups in reducing transaction costs
- The beauty of Ethereum tooling in a Bitcoin-aligned environment
- Patience and debugging finesse in the face of blockchain quirks

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MetaMask** with Citrea Testnet configured  
  - Chain ID: `5115`  
  - RPC: `https://rpc.testnet.citrea.xyz`
  - Get cBTC from faucet
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mip.git
   cd mip
````

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:

   * Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `src/App.js` with your deployed contract address.
   * Add your contract’s ABI to `src/abi.json`.

4. **Run Locally**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:3000` and connect with MetaMask.

5. **Deploy (Optional)**:

   * Build the app:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   * Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred host.

---

## 🧪 Usage

* **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask to link your Citrea Testnet account.
* **Explore Features**: Create pools, stake cBTC, place hedges, and view badges.
* **Verify Transactions**: Use Citrea Testnet Explorer at `https://explorer.testnet.citrea.xyz`.

---

## 🌍 Relevance to Citrea

MIP fully embraces Citrea’s zkEVM by:

* Offering DeFi primitives and gamification to Bitcoin miners—*without wrapped tokens*
* Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs for scalable and cost-effective transactions
* Supporting integration with Bitcoin-native tools like the Light Client and Schnorr signatures

This aligns tightly with Citrea’s mission to scale Bitcoin and inspire meaningful applications.
